        <p>Far far away, behind the word mountains, far from the countries Vokalia and Consonantia, there live the blind texts. Separated they live in Bookmarksgrove right at the coast of the Semantics, a large language ocean.</p>
        <p>A small river named Duden flows by their place and supplies it with the necessary regelialia. It is a paradisematic country, in which roasted parts of sentences fly into your mouth. Even the all-powerful Pointing has no control about the blind texts it is an almost unorthographic life One day however a small line of blind text by the name of Lorem Ipsum decided to</p>

        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Put the water on medium/high heat. Proceed with the following steps while it is warming up</li>
            <li>Roughly chop most of the sage, keep some on the side to garnish the plate at the end</li>
            <li>If you are using garlic, chop it finely</li>
            <li>Put the butter, the chopped sage, and the garlic in a cooking pan on low heat. The butter should melt, but not fry the ingredients</li>
            <li>When the water starts boiling, put salt and the gnocchi</li>
            <li>Raise the heat of the cooking pan just enough to slightly fry the ingredients for a minute or two, which is also the time for the gnocchi to be ready</li>
            <li>As the gnocchi start floating in the pot, use a skimmer to transfer them to the pan. Let them bind with the sauce by cooking them in the pan for an additional minute. Add a spoon or two of cooking water to the pan in case the recipe feels too dry</li>
            <li>Add parmesan and pepper (optional), and garnish with the rest of the sage leaves before serving</li>
        </ol>
